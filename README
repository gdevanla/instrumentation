To install/build:
    mvn install

To use as java agent

    java -javaagent:instrumentation-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar <application class to instrument>

    javassist.jar  is needed for this instrumentor. Get the javassist.jar file and add it to the classpath.

Other Notes:

    Currently, the application only print limited method attributes. All the info is printed in Json format using a light weight Json formatter.
    I still need to remove the hard-coded filter condition!

    TODOs: a. make the data generated by instrumentor configurable.
           b. Accept arugments as regular expressions to only instrument matching classes/methods.
           c.
